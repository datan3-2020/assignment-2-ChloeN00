# Statistical assignment 2: Data Analysis 3

This is statistical assignment 2 for the Data Analysis in Social Science 3 class at the University of Exeter. It will form 10% of your final mark.

The deadline for this assignment is 11 February 2020, 2pm.

You should do the following.

Accept an invitation to clone this repository that I'll send you by email. This will create your own private copy of the repository (with the URL https://github.com/datan3-2020/assignment-2-[your Github account]). The teaching assistant, moderator for the module and I will also have access to this repository.

Once you've cloned the repository you should start a new project in R Studio and clone your Github repo to your computer.

Complete tasks in the assignment2.Rmd file in R Studio. Use R Markdown to produce the file assignment2.md with your output in the "github_document" format.

Commit and push both .Rmd and .md files to your repository for assignment 2 (not your personal module repository). You can make several commits for different tasks, but the last commit should be made before 2pm on 11 February.

You can commit your .Rmd file many times, but please commit your .md file only once when you have the final version of it (you can knit it many times; just keep intermediate versions on your computer without commiting). Your last commit should contain only your final .md file. I am asking you to do this to simplify marking.

Submit a text (for example, Word) document on Bart containing the URL of your repository. You should do this before 2pm on 11 February.

I will mark your assignments as soon as possible (within one week from submission). Your feedback and mark will be available as comments to your final .md file in your last commit. Your mark will also be released via eBart.
